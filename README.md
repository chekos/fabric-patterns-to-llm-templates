# fabric-to-llm-templates

grab the patterns/ prompts from `fabric` and add them as templates for `llm`

## reference:
* `fabric` - https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric
* `llm` - https://github.com/simonw/llm

## why
i already use `llm` - i realize that `fabric` has some other functionality but i just kinda want to use the prompts in the workflows i already have using `llm`.
